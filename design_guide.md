Color Usage Guide
Electric Blue (#3b82f6) use for:

Primary CTA buttons ("View Projects", "Contact Me")
Navigation active/hover states
Technical skill badges (React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python)
Code snippets background
Links in body text
Project card borders on hover

Coral (#ff6b6b) use for:

Secondary CTAs ("Download CV", "View All Projects")
Domain expertise skill badges (Bioinformatics, Data Analysis, Genomics)
External link icons (GitHub, LinkedIn)
Accent elements (underlines, highlights)
"Featured" or "New" project tags
Contact form submit button

Why this split works:

Blue = Technical/Code (aligns with traditional tech colors)
Coral = Domain/Bio (warm, scientific, human element)
Creates visual hierarchy without being overwhelming
Tells your transition story through color

Design Tips
Balance the colors (60-30-10 rule):

60%: Neutral backgrounds and text
30%: Blue (primary accent)
10%: Coral (secondary accent, use sparingly for impact)

Accessibility:

Both colors pass WCAG AA contrast on their backgrounds
Use darker shades for text-on-accent scenarios
Never put coral text on blue background (or vice versa)

Subtle touches:

Use very light tints for section backgrounds (5% opacity blue/coral)
Gradient from blue → coral for hero section background (subtle)
Animate color transitions smoothly (0.2s ease)
